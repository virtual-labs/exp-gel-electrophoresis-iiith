The aim of this experiment is:

1. To develop familiarity with the procedures of a gel electrophoresis technique for the separation of molecules;
2. To separate several dyes of different molecular sizes and charges;
3. To determine the components of an unknown dye mixture by using agar gel electrophoresis.
